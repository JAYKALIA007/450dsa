The question is to print the boundary traversal of a binary tree in anti-clockwise order.
This can be done using the left side view, bottom side view, right side view.
Combinely these 3 will give us the boundary traversal of a binary tree.



Obviously there might be more simple and better solutions, will look into them and update the file later.
